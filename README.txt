Purpose:
	Test CDE backend by matching local program output with output
	generated by the server.  
	

Getting Started:
	1. Edit the config.json file to match your local environment
	2. All you need to do next is run driver.rb to test the CDE backend

Required JSON Format:
	{
		"container" : "ID of a public CDE container", 
		"language" : {
			"compile" : "Compile needed to compile the source file e.g. gcc (optional)",
			"execute" : "Prefix needed to run the executable e.g. ruby"
		},
		"options" : {
			"verbose" : "Prints test messages of the scaffold module",
			"verbose+" : "Prints test messages of the individual testing module"
		}
	}

Extendibility:
	1. Add test cases to the different suites
	2. Add a config.json detailing how the test should be run
	3. Execute driver.rb to test your test case
